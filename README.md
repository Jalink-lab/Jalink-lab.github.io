## Welcome to Jalink Lab.

Here you can find several [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) scripts for automated reconstruction of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) images.

#SR_postProcess.ijm
This macro is basically a wrapper around the ImageJ plugin [ThunderSTRORM](https://zitmen.github.io/thunderstorm/).
It allows processing multiple blinking movies in a folder. In the dialog the most important settings of ThunderSTORM can be set. (Other parameters are set to default, and/or can be changed in the macro code before running. (@rharkes nog even checken of dit waar is?)





Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
